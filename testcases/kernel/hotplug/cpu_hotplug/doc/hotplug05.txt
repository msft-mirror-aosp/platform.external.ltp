Testcase 05
-----------

It's been found that sometimes onlining and offlining CPUs confuse some
of the various system tools.  We found that sar wouldn't register the change
in newly available cpus that weren't there when it started. This
test case seeks to exercise this known error cases and verify that
they behave correctly now.

Algorithm - Sar
===============
Given a CPU to test that exists

Make sure the specified cpu is offline

Loop until done:
  Start up sar writing to a temp log and give it a little time to run

  Verify that SAR has correctly displayed all fields of CPU statistics
  as '0.00' for the offlined CPU or just not displayed it in its tmp log

  Online the specified cpu

  Take another timestamp and another count of offlined CPUs

  Verify SAR registered the change in CPU online/offline states

When exiting:
  Kill the sar process
