Testcase 06
-----------

It's been found that sometimes onlining and offlining CPUs confuse some
of the various system tools.  We found it caused top to
crash.  This test case seeks to exercise this known error cases and
verify that they behave correctly now.

Algorithm - Top
===============
Given a CPU to test that exists

Make sure the specified cpu is online

Loop until done:
  Start up top and give it a little time to run

  Offline the specified CPU

  Wait a little time for top to notice the CPU is gone

  Now check that top hasn't crashed by verifying its PID is still
  being reported by ps.

When exiting:
  Kill the top process
  Restore all CPUs to their initial state
