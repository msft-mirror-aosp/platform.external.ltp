Although we *occasionally* also accept GitHub pull requests, the *preferred* way is sending patches to our mailing list: https://lore.kernel.org/ltp/

There is an example how to use it: https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/C-Test-Case-Tutorial#7-submitting-the-test-for-review (using git format-patch and git send-email).

LTP mailing list is archived at: https://lore.kernel.org/ltp/.
We also have a patchwork instance: https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/ltp/list/.
